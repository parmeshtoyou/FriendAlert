I finished this entire application about 6 months ago and was ready to publish to Play Store. However, my laptop crashed and wiped out my project. I did not have this project on Github, so had to start over. I took this as a learning opportunity. Instead of building it the same way as I did before, I decided to integrate new tools that are widely being adopted in the current world of Android dev. 

This project is my first attempt at implementing Dagger 2, ReactiveX, and Clean Architecture while trying to realize an app idea to life. It is still a work in progress. As much as I want to finish this app and publish to the store, my main goal with this application is to learn so I am constantly refactoring.

I currently have the application in a stable state in terms of dependency injection, using reactivex and properly keeping the structure of "Clean". I am in no way an expert in these topics. Constantly learning more about each as I go further with the application and refactor whenever I have an "AHA!" moment.

Current goal is to get the core functionality working.
Once that is achieved, move on to making the app look pretty and feel like a real application.
